analysis and problems in the tables

1) MISMATCHES
In the dataset, various mismatches were identified between the aggregated player statistics
(fgMade, ftMade, threeMade) and the team totals (o_fgm, o_ftm, o_3pm).
To resolve this discrepancy, the team values were updated to match the sum of the individual player data.
This ensures that the team totals accurately reflect the contributions from each player,
providing a more reliable and consistent dataset for future analysis.

2) COACHES
some teams during the same year changed coach,
the same coaches who were fired were not hired by any other team afterward.
